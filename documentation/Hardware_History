NOVA HARDWARE HISTORY

NOVA V1 - V4 were on a 25mm x 25mm base and were roughly 50mm tall
NOVA V5 35 x 40 mm perfboard


NOVA V1
	Never Left CAD
  
NOVA V2
	Bread Board Model
	Components
		Arduino Nano (ATMEGA 328p)
    	ICM-20948
    	Servo
    
NOVA V3
    First Flown Version
    components
    	Arduino Nano (ATMEGA 328p)
    	ICM-20948 
    	BME280
    	uSD card
    	Servo
    goal
    	detect Launch and use servo to deploy a parachute from a water rocket
  	Flight History
    	Flight 1 - Partial Failure
      		lower than expected flight pressure led to shorter time to Apogee, parachute deployed roughly 40 ft above ground destroying the parachute and 
			damaging the flight computer
    	Flight 2 - Failure
      		Data Failed to save to uSD card
      
NOVA V4
    Scrapped
    components
    	Teensy 4.0
    	ICM-20948
    	BME280
    	uSD
    	HC-05 BT
    notes
    	size limitations and terrible wiring led to the package not working in the configuration it was currently in.
    
NOVA V5
    Partially destroyed
    components
    	teensy 4.0
    	ICM-20948
    	BME280
    	uSD
    	RunCam Split 3 Lite
    notes
    	repackaged to fit together differently
    	first version to use perfboard and header pins to attach components
    	added on-board camera
    Scheduled Flights
    	Flight 1 - Aquila II, H54, HPR L1 CERT
    	
    Flight History
        Flight 1, Failure, parachute deployment failure unrealted to system
