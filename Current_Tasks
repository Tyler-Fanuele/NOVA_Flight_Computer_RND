Devon's Comments:
1. See if my edits to NOVA_0920B found in the NOVA_0920B_RO.ino file compile fine. If they do, commit them to SRC. Im not trying to write them to be compliant with the guidelines yet, just get them into a more readable state before we make the next version of the flight computer.
2. If everyone is okay with it can we please keep SRC only for the most up to date files and create a secondary folder for older versions? 
Please Indicate here if you are okay with that:
